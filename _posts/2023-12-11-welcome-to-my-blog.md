Welcome to my blog! I come from China. After living in Beijing for almost 12 years, I moved to the Netherlands. Here I can enjoy the 'small' and 'beautiful' views from villages, farms, towns, canals,... Everything is so easily reachable.

This online place is to log everything from my daily life. I read a lot, coded a lot but left little. So at the beginning of the second week of my unemployed life, I decided to write down things I am doing, like currently learning C++, to leave some useful hints for other people, and also to push me to think deeply and say logically, which I see is a disadvantage of my working style.

I plan to continuously write down the following topics:
* Life adventure
* Life thoughts
* Technical logs

Thanks for visting!
