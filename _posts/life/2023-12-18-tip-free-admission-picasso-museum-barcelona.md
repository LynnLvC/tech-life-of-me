### Picasso Museum

In Spain most cultural places, like museums are open at some specific time to publics, to enable everyone enjoy the culture equally.

For PICASSO MUSEUM, the free admission tickets are availble for every Thursdays, from 5pm onwards, first Sunday of each month, 12 February (santa Eulàlia), 18 May (the International day of Museums) and 24 September (La Mercè). 

As its limited capacity, timed tickets are required. Advance tickets are available online up to 4 days before the date. 

However, it does not say when exactly ticket will be availble online. I googled but cannot find the answer.
I was trying to book the ticket on 21-12-2023 , so I checked the [website][kramdown hp] since 7 am on 17-12-2023, but I could see nothing availble until 12pm. However, around 5pm, I tried again, and found the ticket.

I guess the ticket should be availble since 4 pm, which is the open time for the free admission.

So here are the tips:
> Book the ticket at 4 pm on Sunday if you want to enter on the coming Thursday

And:
> if you donn't need the audio guide, select the first link only. For the audio guide,  €5 for each

### Barcelona card
>Update{: .red}

We decided to buy the Barcelona Card Modernista to visit most attractions for free. However, one day before the departure, the price increased from Є90 to Є130. But there was another link we could buy for Є117 [Here][kramdown hp]. It's the same card but a different price, Weird!

Eventually, we bought the Barcelona Express Card, which includes the 48-hour free public transportation and discounts to a lot of attractions.
I thought it would save us a lot of money. However, with this card (and all the other cards), we had to buy the ticket on-site. Waiting in the queue was not a trouble, because they were not too long.

However, the on-site tickets are generally more expensive than those online. We tried Casa Mila and Casa Batllo.  It was annoying. So we had to buy tickets online without using the discount card.

So we spent more on the card but got almost no discount and only for 2 days free public transportation, compared to the 3-day free public transportation card.
