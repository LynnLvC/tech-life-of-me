In spain most cultural places, like museums are open at some specific time to publics, to enable everyone enjoy the culture equally.

For PICASSO MUSEUM, the free admission tickets are availble for every Thursdays, from 5pm onwards, first Sunday of each month, 12 February (santa Eulàlia), 18 May (the International day of Museums) and 24 September (La Mercè). 

As its limited capacity, timed tickets are required. Advance tickets are available online up to 4 days before the date. 

However, it does not say when exactly ticket will be availble online. I googled but cannot find the answer.
I was trying to book the ticket on 21-12-2023 , so I checked the [website][kramdown hp] since 7 am on 17-12-2023, but I could see nothing availble until 12pm. However, around 5pm, I tried again, and found the ticket.![ticket] (\assets\images\life\ticket-PICASSO-MUSEUM.png){: .align-center}

I guess the ticket should be availble since 4 pm, which is the open time for the free admission.

So here are the tips:
> book the ticket at 4 pm on Sunday.

And:
> if you donn't need the audio guide, select the first link only. For the audio guide,  €5 for each
